This repository presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth's business data, designed to address strategic questions from the management board as part of their 2020 company strategy. The analysis explores several key areas, including which films contributed the most or least to revenue, average rental durations, customer distribution by region, lifetime value hotspots, and regional sales performance. SQL was utilized to extract and analyze the data, delivering data-driven insights. Visualizations accompany the findings to provide Rockbuster's management with clear, actionable information. This project not only demonstrates SQL proficiency but also highlights the capability to solve complex business challenges relevant across various sectors.
